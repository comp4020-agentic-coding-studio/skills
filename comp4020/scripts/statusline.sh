# COMP4020 status line: your weekly strproxy budget, e.g. "$12.34/$100 (12%)".
#
# The render path never touches the network. It prints a cached figure and, if
# that figure has gone stale, kicks off a detached refresh for the *next*
# render. Claude Code re-runs the status line after every assistant message and
# cancels a run that is still going when the next one fires --- so a blocking
# curl (which, on a laptop off the ANU VPN, hangs until it times out) would
# leave the bar permanently empty.
#
# The canonical copy lives in the comp4020 plugin; a SessionStart hook syncs it
# to ~/.claude/comp4020/statusline.sh, which is what settings.json points at.
# The plugin's own path is content-hashed and changes on every update, so it
# can't be named in settings.json. Don't edit the installed copy --- the hook
# overwrites it.
#
# Reads nothing from stdin, so it composes: an existing status line script can
# append `"$HOME/.claude/comp4020/statusline.sh" </dev/null` to its own output.
