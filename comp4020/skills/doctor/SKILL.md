# COMP4020 environment doctor

Diagnose the student's local setup against the course's required tools, then
**offer to fix** what's wrong. This is a laptop health check — the tools they
need installed and, crucially, whether the ones that hit external services
(`gh`, `flyctl`, the strproxy key) are authenticated and reachable.

## Ground truth: fetch the required-tools list live

The canonical list of required and recommended tools lives on the course site,
so fetch it rather than trusting this file to stay current:

```
https://comp.anu.edu.au/courses/comp4020-agentic-coding-studio/api/topics/software-environment.json
```

Read its `body`. The checks below cover every tool that page currently lists. If
the fetched page names a tool this skill doesn't know how to check, report it as
"listed on the site — verify manually" rather than skipping it silently: that
gap is a signal the skill has drifted from the site, worth flagging to the
convenor.

## Detect the platform first

Run `uname -s` (and check for WSL). Tailor every check and fix to the result:

- **macOS** (`Darwin`) — Homebrew-first fixes.
- **Linux** (`Linux`, no WSL marker) — distro package manager.
- **WSL** (`Linux` with `microsoft` in `/proc/version`) — treat as Linux; this
  is the supported Windows path.
- **Native Windows** (no Unix shell) — this is off the supported path. Point at
  the WSL2 warning on the software-environment page and recommend installing
  WSL2 before going further; most other checks won't apply cleanly.

## Checks

Run these, classify each **PASS / WARN / FAIL**, and collect a suggested fix for
anything not PASS. Required tools that are missing or misconfigured are FAIL;
recommended tools (mise, package manager) are WARN.

### Git (required)

- `git --version` — installed? Assume a 4th-year student already has their name
  and email configured; don't check or offer to set `user.name`/`user.email`.

### GitHub CLI `gh` (required, hits an external service)

- `gh --version` — installed?
- `gh auth status` — authenticated to github.com? Exits non-zero when not logged
  in. This is the check that matters: an installed-but-unauthenticated `gh`
  fails the moment they try to clone or open a PR. Fix: `gh auth login` (walk
  them through the browser flow; suggest HTTPS + "Login with a web browser").

### Course GitHub org membership (required, hits an external service)

Every weekly prototype and every assignment repo is generated for you inside the
`comp4020-agentic-coding-studio` org, and you're added to your own as an admin.
Being an **active member** of that org is what makes that silent — a non-member
gets an invitation email per repo instead, and, more to the point, the course's
provisioning refuses to create a repo for anyone who hasn't joined. If this
check fails, you will have nothing to clone on Monday.

```sh
gh api /user/memberships/orgs/comp4020-agentic-coding-studio --jq .state
```

- `active` — PASS.
- `pending` — FAIL. The invitation is sitting there unaccepted. **Org
  invitations expire after seven days**, so don't leave it. One call accepts it,
  and you can offer to run it:
  ```sh
  gh api --method PATCH /user/memberships/orgs/comp4020-agentic-coding-studio \
    -f state=active
  ```
- `404` / "Not Found" — FAIL, but work out which kind before advising. If
  `gh auth status` doesn't list the `read:org` scope, the check itself is blind:
  `gh auth refresh -h github.com -s read:org` and try again. If the scope is
  there, then either no invitation was ever sent, or it lapsed. That's the
  convenor's end, not theirs — comp4020@anu.edu.au.

Never guess between those two. Telling a student to email the convenor about a
scope problem on their own laptop wastes everyone's week.

### flyctl (required for the full-stack half, hits an external service)

The binary is `flyctl` (also symlinked as `fly`). Only hard-FAIL this in the
full-stack half of the course; in the static half a missing flyctl is a WARN
("you'll need this from week 7").

- `flyctl version` — installed?
- `flyctl auth whoami` — logged in?
- `flyctl orgs list` — are they a member of the course-managed org? The org name
  is on the
  [platforms](https://comp.anu.edu.au/courses/comp4020-agentic-coding-studio/topics/platforms/)
  page; fetch it if you need to name the expected org. Not being in it is a WARN
  (they may not have accepted the invite yet).
- **Payment method**: the course covers billing, so students must not add their
  own card. There's no reliable CLI check for this, so don't assert it — just
  remind them, if flyctl is set up, not to add a payment method and to point any
  billing prompts at the platforms page.
- Fixes: `flyctl auth login`; for org membership, check for the invite email or
  contact the convenor.

### Claude Code + strproxy (required, hits an external service)

They're running inside Claude Code, so it's installed. What matters is that it's
routed through the course proxy and the key works:

- `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` set to the strproxy host (default
  `https://strproxy.comp.anu.edu.au`) and `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` set to an
  `sk-…` key? These normally live in `~/.claude/settings.json` under `env`.
  Missing means they're either on their own Anthropic billing or unconfigured —
  route them to the **quickstart** skill.
- **Live probe**: `GET /api/me` with the key confirms three things at once — the
  key is valid, the proxy is reachable, and they're on the ANU network/VPN:
  ```sh
  curl -sf "${ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL:-https://strproxy.comp.anu.edu.au}/api/me" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN" >/dev/null && echo OK
  ```
  A 200 is PASS. A connection failure/403 almost always means "not on the ANU
  VPN" (their actual Claude sessions still work — only `/api/*` is
  network-restricted); a 401 means the key is wrong or revoked → quickstart /
  Canvas. Don't treat a VPN-only failure as a broken setup.
- **Permission mode**: the course recommends auto mode. If you can see they're
  in default/plan mode, mention auto mode as a flow improvement (not a FAIL).
  Never nudge toward `--dangerously-skip-permissions`.
- Never print the key value back to the user.

### Budget status line (optional)

Opt-in, so **absence is not a failure**. If `~/.claude/settings.json` has no
`statusLine` block and no `~/.claude/comp4020/` directory, the student never
asked for it: say nothing and move on. Only diagnose it if they've turned it on,
or if they're asking why it isn't working.

Once it _is_ on, the failure modes are quiet — an empty or frozen bar, never an
error. Check in this order:

- **`jq` installed?** `command -v jq`. This is the one dependency that isn't
  already on a stock macOS or minimal Ubuntu, and without it the bar reads
  `budget: needs jq`. WARN, not FAIL. Fix: `brew install jq` (macOS),
  `sudo apt install jq` (Debian/Ubuntu/WSL), or `mise use -g jq` (any platform,
  and mise is already recommended below).
- **Script installed and executable?**
  `test -x ~/.claude/comp4020/statusline.sh`. If the directory exists but the
  script doesn't, the `SessionStart` hook hasn't run yet — restarting Claude
  Code installs it. If that doesn't fix it, the plugin isn't enabled:
  `/plugin install comp4020@comp4020`.
- **`settings.json` points at it?** The `statusLine.command` should be
  `$HOME/.claude/comp4020/statusline.sh`. A student who already had their own
  status line may have it pointing elsewhere — that's fine and deliberate; check
  whether their script calls ours (see the **quickstart** skill, step 6).
- **Native Windows** — there's no Unix shell to run it in. Not a FAIL; it's the
  same WSL2 story as everything else.

Two symptoms worth naming, because neither is a broken setup:

- **`budget: ?`** means the script has never once reached `/api/me`. Nearly
  always the ANU VPN, exactly as with the live probe above. Their Claude
  sessions are unaffected.
- **A number that won't move.** Expected: the figure is cached for 60 seconds
  and refreshed in the background, so it always lags a little. Off the VPN it
  will sit on the last figure it managed to fetch, indefinitely. If they want
  the authoritative number now, that's the **check-balance** skill.

### Chrome ≥ 140 (required)

Version detection is per-OS:

- macOS:
  `"/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome" --version`
- Linux/WSL: `google-chrome --version` or `google-chrome-stable --version`

Parse the major version; below 140 is a WARN with an "update Chrome" nudge.
Can't find it at all → WARN (they may have it elsewhere; ask).

### mise (recommended)

`mise --version`. Missing is a WARN — it's recommended, not required. Fix per
platform (`brew install mise`, or the install script).

### System package manager (recommended)

macOS: `brew --version`. Debian/Ubuntu/WSL: `apt --version`. Missing is a WARN.

## Report, then offer to fix

1. Print a compact per-tool summary: `PASS` / `WARN` / `FAIL` with a one-line
   reason. Lead with the FAILs.
2. For each non-PASS item, state the exact fix command.
3. **Offer to run the fixes, confirming each one before you run it.** Safe
   config edits (merging into `settings.json` via the quickstart flow) you can
   do directly on confirmation; interactive external logins (`gh auth login`,
   `flyctl auth login`) open a browser and can't be fully automated — run them
   for the user (they'll complete the browser step) or hand them the command,
   whichever the situation calls for. Never run a fix without an explicit yes.
4. If everything's green, say so plainly and stop — no busywork.

## Handing off

- No proxy key configured → the **quickstart** skill.
- "How much budget do I have" / over-budget → the **check-balance** skill.
- Anything about course rules, deadlines, or what a tool is _for_ → the
  **course-info** skill.
