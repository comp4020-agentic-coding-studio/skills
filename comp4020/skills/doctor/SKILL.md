# COMP4020 environment doctor

Diagnose the student's local setup against the course's required tools, then
**offer to fix** what's wrong. This is a laptop health check — the tools they
need installed and, crucially, whether the ones that hit external services
(`gh`, `flyctl`, the strproxy key) are authenticated and reachable.

## Ground truth: fetch the required-tools list live

The canonical list of required and recommended tools lives on the course site's
quickstart page, so fetch it rather than trusting this file to stay current:

```
https://comp.anu.edu.au/courses/comp4020-agentic-coding-studio/api/topics/quickstart.json
```

Read its `body`. The checks below cover every tool that page currently lists. If
the fetched page names a tool this skill doesn't know how to check, report it as
"listed on the site — verify manually" rather than skipping it silently: that
gap is a signal the skill has drifted from the site, worth flagging to the
convenor.

## Detect the platform first

Run `uname -s` (and check for WSL). Tailor every check and fix to the result:

- **macOS** (`Darwin`) — Homebrew-first fixes.
- **Linux** (`Linux`, no WSL marker) — distro package manager.
- **WSL** (`Linux` with `microsoft` in `/proc/version`) — treat as Linux; this
  is the supported Windows path.
- **Native Windows** (no Unix shell) — this is off the supported path. Point at
  the WSL2 warning on the quickstart page and recommend installing WSL2 before
  going further; most other checks won't apply cleanly.

## Checks

Run these, classify each **PASS / WARN / FAIL**, and collect a suggested fix for
anything not PASS. Required tools that are missing or misconfigured are FAIL;
recommended tools (mise, package manager) are WARN.

### Git (required)

- `git --version` — installed? Assume a 4th-year student already has their name
  and email configured; don't check or offer to set `user.name`/`user.email`.

### GitHub CLI `gh` (required, hits an external service)

- `gh --version` — installed?
- `gh auth status` — authenticated to github.com? Exits non-zero when not logged
  in. This is the check that matters: an installed-but-unauthenticated `gh`
  fails the moment they try to clone or open a PR. Fix: `gh auth login` (walk
  them through the browser flow; suggest HTTPS + "Login with a web browser").
- `gh repo edit --help | grep -q accept-visibility-change-consequences` — new
  enough? Check the capability, not a version number. A distro-packaged `gh`
  (Ubuntu still ships 2.45) predates that flag, so **ship**'s public flip dies
  with `unknown flag` — and it dies at the cutoff, which is the worst possible
  time to discover it. Fix: install `gh` from GitHub's own apt repo or Homebrew
  rather than `apt install gh`.

### Course GitHub org membership (required, hits an external service)

Every weekly prototype and every assignment repo is generated for you inside the
`comp4020-agentic-coding-studio` org, and you're added to your own as an admin.
Being an **active member** of that org is what makes that silent — a non-member
gets an invitation email per repo instead, and, more to the point, the course's
provisioning refuses to create a repo for anyone who hasn't joined. If this
check fails, you will have nothing to clone on Monday.

```sh
gh api /user/memberships/orgs/comp4020-agentic-coding-studio --jq .state
```

- `active` — PASS.
- `pending` — FAIL. The invitation is sitting there unaccepted. **Org
  invitations expire after seven days**, so don't leave it. One call accepts it,
  and you can offer to run it:
  ```sh
  gh api --method PATCH /user/memberships/orgs/comp4020-agentic-coding-studio \
    -f state=active
  ```
- `404` / "Not Found" — FAIL, but work out which kind before advising. If
  `gh auth status` doesn't list the `read:org` scope, the check itself is blind:
  `gh auth refresh -h github.com -s read:org` and try again. If the scope is
  there, then either no invitation was ever sent, or it lapsed. That's the
  convenor's end, not theirs — comp4020@anu.edu.au.

Never guess between those two. Telling a student to email the convenor about a
scope problem on their own laptop wastes everyone's week.

### flyctl (required for the full-stack half, hits an external service)

The binary is `flyctl` (also symlinked as `fly`). Only hard-FAIL this in the
full-stack half of the course; in the static half a missing flyctl is a WARN
("you'll need this from the full-stack half, week 8 onwards").

- `flyctl version` — installed?
- `flyctl auth whoami` — logged in?
- `flyctl orgs list` — each student's app lives in their own per-student linked
  Fly org (`comp4020-<uid>`), not one shared course org, so there's no single
  org name to assert here. What matters is that the invited account shows _some_
  org beyond their personal one — seeing only "personal" is a WARN (invites go
  out ahead of the full-stack half, and they may not have accepted theirs yet).
- **Payment method**: the course covers billing, so students must not add their
  own card. There's no reliable CLI check for this, so don't assert it — just
  remind them, if flyctl is set up, not to add a payment method and to point any
  billing prompts at the software-and-platforms page.
- Fixes: `flyctl auth login`; for org membership, check for the invite email or
  contact the convenor.

### Claude Code + strproxy (required, hits an external service)

They're running inside Claude Code, so it's installed. What matters is that it's
routed through the course proxy and the key works:

- `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` set to the strproxy host (default
  `https://strproxy.comp.anu.edu.au`) and `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` set to an
  `sk-…` key? These normally live in `~/.claude/settings.json` under `env` — but
  a student with their own Claude subscription scopes them to course repos
  instead (quickstart step 3's dual-plan branch), so also check
  `.claude/settings.local.json` at the repo root if the current directory is
  inside a course repo. For a dual-plan student, the vars being absent _outside_
  course repos is the setup working, not a failure. Missing in both places means
  they're either on their own Anthropic billing everywhere or unconfigured — ask
  which before routing them to the **quickstart** skill.
- `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` pinned (the course default is `claude-sonnet-5`), in the
  same settings file as the other two vars? Not a hard failure — everything
  works without it — but unpinned Claude Code defaults API-key users to Opus,
  which burns the weekly budget several times faster, so WARN and offer to add
  it (quickstart step 3 has the block).
- **Live probe**: `GET /api/me` with the key confirms three things at once — the
  key is valid, the proxy is reachable, and they're on the ANU network/VPN:
  ```sh
  curl -sf "${ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL:-https://strproxy.comp.anu.edu.au}/api/me" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN" >/dev/null && echo OK
  ```
  A 200 is PASS. A connection failure/403 almost always means "not on the ANU
  VPN" (their actual Claude sessions still work — only `/api/*` is
  network-restricted); a 401 means the key is wrong or revoked → quickstart /
  Canvas. Don't treat a VPN-only failure as a broken setup.
- **Permission mode**: the course recommends auto mode. If you can see they're
  in default/plan mode, mention auto mode as a flow improvement (not a FAIL).
  Never nudge toward `--dangerously-skip-permissions`.
- Never print the key value back to the user.

### Course plugin up to date (recommended)

They're running this skill from the `comp4020` plugin, so it's installed — the
question is whether it's current. Skills get fixed and extended through the
semester, and a stale copy fails in ways that don't look like a version problem.

- `claude plugin marketplace update comp4020` first, so the comparison is
  against the marketplace's current state rather than a stale local copy.
- `claude plugin list --json --available` — compare the installed `comp4020`
  version against the marketplace's latest. Behind is a WARN. Fix:
  `claude plugin update comp4020@comp4020`, then restart Claude Code (updates
  only apply to new sessions). If `comp4020-statusline` is installed, check it
  the same way.

### Pre-commit key guard (required, repo-scoped)

Only applies when the current directory is inside a course prototype repo — one
whose root has a `.githooks/pre-commit` (every course template ships it, to
block commits that contain anything shaped like an API key). Outside such a
repo, skip silently: there's nothing to check.

- `git config core.hooksPath` should print `.githooks`. The template's `prepare`
  script sets this when `pnpm install` runs, so unset means they haven't
  installed yet and the guard is **off** — FAIL. Fix: `pnpm install` (which they
  need anyway), or directly `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`.
- While you're there, check nothing key-shaped is already committed:
  `git grep --cached -nE 'sk-[A-Za-z0-9_-]{20,}'`. Any hit is FAIL. Report the
  file and line **only — never print the matched value**. The key has to come
  out of the file, and if the commit has ever been pushed, treat the key as
  leaked: private Ed thread to the teaching team to get it rotated.

### Crit group (recommended)

- `COMP4020_GROUP` set — in the environment, backed by `~/.claude/settings.json`
  under `env` — and equal to one of the group ids (the agent's name, lowercase,
  e.g. `shitao`) listed at `/api/crit-groups.json`? Missing or misspelled is a
  WARN, not a FAIL: nothing breaks, but the deadline-aware skills
  (**submission-preflight**, **ship**, **deadline-radar**) can only say "two
  hours before your session" instead of quoting the student's actual crit
  cutoff. Fix: the **quickstart** skill, step 6 (ask which group, merge the
  variable into settings).

### Budget status line (optional)

Opt-in, so **absence is not a failure**. If `~/.claude/settings.json` has no
`statusLine` block and the `comp4020-statusline` plugin isn't installed, the
student never asked for it: say nothing and move on. Only diagnose it if they've
turned it on, or if they're asking why it isn't working. (Don't read
`~/.claude/comp4020/` as consent — the plugin's hook creates that directory on
install, before any status line exists.)

Once it _is_ on, the script always prints one of two tags: `comp4020` followed
by the budget when the session runs on course credits, or a dim `own plan` when
it doesn't (personal subscription, personal key, another gateway). So the first
diagnostic question is which of three states they're in: a **completely empty
segment** means the script isn't running at all (plugin/script/settings — the
middle checks below); **`own plan`** means the script works but the session
isn't routed through strproxy; **`comp4020` with a stale or missing figure** is
the quiet-failure territory (VPN, cache) at the end. Check in this order:

- **`jq` installed?** `command -v jq`. This is the one dependency that isn't
  already on a stock macOS or minimal Ubuntu, and without it the bar reads
  `comp4020 budget: needs jq`. WARN, not FAIL. Fix: `brew install jq` (macOS),
  `sudo apt install jq` (Debian/Ubuntu/WSL), or `mise use -g jq` (any platform,
  and mise is already recommended below).
- **Companion plugin installed?** The script ships in `comp4020-statusline`, a
  separate opt-in plugin, not in `comp4020`. `claude plugin list` should show
  it. If not: `claude plugin install comp4020-statusline@comp4020`.
- **Script installed and executable?**
  `test -x ~/.claude/comp4020/statusline.sh`. If the plugin is installed but the
  script isn't there, its `SessionStart` hook hasn't run yet — restarting Claude
  Code installs it.
- **`settings.json` points at it?** The `statusLine.command` should be
  `$HOME/.claude/comp4020/statusline.sh`. Installing the plugin does **not**
  write this (no plugin can set `statusLine`), so this is the step people miss.
  A student who already had their own status line may have it pointing elsewhere
  — that's fine and deliberate; check whether their script calls ours (see the
  **quickstart** skill, step 7).
- **Routed through strproxy?** The script shows the budget only when
  `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` names the strproxy host and `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` holds
  a virtual key — by design, so it never sends a credential to a host it wasn't
  given; otherwise it shows `own plan`. Whether `own plan` is correct depends on
  the setup: on someone's own Claude subscription outside course work it's
  exactly right, and for a dual-plan student it's right everywhere _except_
  inside a course repo — seeing it there means the repo's
  `.claude/settings.local.json` is missing (fresh weekly clone, usually) →
  **quickstart** step 3, dual-plan branch.
- **Native Windows** — there's no Unix shell to run it in. Not a FAIL; it's the
  same WSL2 story as everything else.

Two symptoms that are not a broken setup: **`comp4020 budget: ?`** means the
script has never reached `/api/me` — nearly always the ANU VPN, as with the live
probe above — and **a number that won't move** is the 60-second cache (off the
VPN it sits on the last fetched figure indefinitely). Either way their Claude
sessions are unaffected, and the authoritative number is the **check-balance**
skill.

### Chrome ≥ 140 (required)

Version detection is per-OS:

- macOS:
  `"/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome" --version`
- Linux/WSL: `google-chrome --version` or `google-chrome-stable --version`

Parse the major version; below 140 is a WARN with an "update Chrome" nudge.
Can't find it at all → WARN (they may have it elsewhere; ask).

### mise (recommended)

`mise --version`. Missing is a WARN — it's recommended, not required. Fix per
platform (`brew install mise`, or the install script).

### System package manager (recommended)

macOS: `brew --version`. Debian/Ubuntu/WSL: `apt --version`. Missing is a WARN.

## Report, then offer to fix

1. Print a compact per-tool summary: `PASS` / `WARN` / `FAIL` with a one-line
   reason. Lead with the FAILs.
2. For each non-PASS item, state the exact fix command.
3. **Offer to run the fixes, confirming each one before you run it.** Safe
   config edits (merging into `settings.json` via the quickstart flow) you can
   do directly on confirmation; interactive external logins (`gh auth login`,
   `flyctl auth login`) open a browser and can't be fully automated — run them
   for the user (they'll complete the browser step) or hand them the command,
   whichever the situation calls for. Never run a fix without an explicit yes.
4. If everything's green, say so plainly and stop — no busywork.

## Handing off

- No proxy key configured → the **quickstart** skill.
- "How much budget do I have" / over-budget → the **check-balance** skill.
- Anything about course rules, deadlines, or what a tool is _for_ → the
  **course-info** skill.
