  Ships a COMP4020/COMP8020 deliverable — flips the repo public, enables GitHub
  Pages, triggers the deploy, checks the live URL actually serves, and in the
  final-project run (weeks 9–11) tags the crit cutoff state. Use when the user
  says "ship it", "make my repo public", "flip it public", "publish my
  prototype", "enable Pages", or "deploy for the crit". Not for checking whether
  the work is ready; that's submission-preflight.

# COMP4020 ship

This is the one irreversible thing you will do in this course. The moment the
repo goes public, your entire commit history and every CI log in it have been
served to the world. A later `git push --force` does not unring that: it was
fetched, cached, and possibly indexed. Treat the flip with the seriousness it
deserves, and never do it on a repo you haven't just read.

Everything up to the flip is reversible. The flip is not. So this skill does the
checking first, the scanning second, and the flip last, and it stops at the
first sign of trouble.

## 1. Confirm what you're shipping

Default to the git repo in the current directory, and confirm it before judging
it (`gh repo view --json nameWithOwner,visibility,isArchived`). It must be in
the `comp4020-agentic-coding-studio` org — a repo under a personal account is
not the one your tutor marks, and shipping it publishes work to a place nobody
is looking.

Then identify the deliverable and quote its real cutoff from the course site
(the same `/api/index.json` route **course-info** uses). For a crit the cutoff
is group-relative — resolve it from `$COMP4020_GROUP` and the `groups` entries
in `/api/crit-groups.json`, exactly as **submission-preflight** does. Shipping
after the cutoff is allowed and shipping early costs nothing, but the student
should hear the actual time out loud before anything becomes public.

## 2. Is it even ready?

Run **submission-preflight** and read its verdict. If it reports any FAIL, stop
and say so. Do not offer to flip anyway: a public repo with uncommitted work in
the tree is worse than a private repo with the same, because now the gap is
permanent and visible.

WARNs are the student's call. Show them, ask, continue only on a clear yes.

## 3. Scan for secrets, before the flip

This is the step that cannot be done afterwards. Look through the working tree
**and the history** — the history is the part people forget:

```sh
git log --all -p | rg -i 'api[_-]?key|secret|token|password|BEGIN [A-Z ]*PRIVATE KEY|sk-[A-Za-z0-9]{20,}'
gh api /repos/{owner}/{repo}/actions/runs --jq '.workflow_runs[].id'   # logs go public too
```

Also check for the things a course repo specifically accumulates: an
`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` pasted into a `.env` that got committed once and deleted
later, a `.claude/settings.local.json`, a fly.io deploy token in a script.

Anything you find is a **stop**. Removing a secret from the tip commit does not
remove it from history, and rewriting history on a repo that has never been
public is easy while doing it afterwards is not. Tell them to rotate the
credential regardless, because a leaked key must be assumed leaked.

If it's clean, say what you searched for and what you did not. You are not a
secret scanner, and a green result here is not a guarantee.

## 4. Flip, deploy, verify

Confirm explicitly, in one sentence that names what becomes public: _"this makes
`<repo>` — all source, all commit history, all CI logs — permanently public.
Proceed?"_ Then, and only then:

```sh
gh repo edit <owner>/<repo> --visibility public --accept-visibility-change-consequences
```

You are a repo admin on your own repo, so this works. If it 403s, you are not
admin, or the org has restricted visibility changes — say so, don't retry. If it
dies with `unknown flag` instead, the `gh` is a distro-packaged one older than
2.46 (doctor checks for this); the API call needs no flag:

```sh
gh api -X PATCH /repos/<owner>/<repo> -f visibility=public
```

For the **static half** (weeks 2–6), the flip is what makes Pages available.
Enable it as a **workflow** site, then dispatch the deploy workflow and wait:

```sh
gh api -X POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/pages -f build_type=workflow
gh workflow run <deploy workflow> && gh run watch
```

`build_type=workflow` is load-bearing, and the tempting alternative
(`-f 'source[branch]=main' -f 'source[path]=/'`) is actively wrong here. It
makes a _legacy_ Pages site that publishes the branch root — your unbuilt
source, where `index.html` still points at `main.ts` no browser can run — and it
arms GitHub's own `pages build and deployment` job, which fires on every push,
ignores whether your checks passed, and races the real deploy. The symptom is a
marked URL that intermittently serves a broken site, including from commits CI
rejected. The deploy job can't enable Pages for you either: creating a Pages
site needs admin, and `GITHUB_TOKEN` isn't ("Resource not accessible by
integration"), which is why this step is yours to run.

For the **full-stack half** (weeks 8+), the deploy is gated on the same
visibility flip — CI's `deploy` job only runs once the repo is public, same as
Pages. The flip triggers no push event, so dispatch the workflow and wait,
exactly as above:

```sh
gh workflow run <deploy workflow> && gh run watch
```

That single run builds and checks the app, then — once `check` passes — deploys
to Fly and verifies the live URL and the live-update stream itself. You never
hold the deploy credential: the token is a repo secret installed at
provisioning, so never run `flyctl deploy` yourself. If the run fails in the
`deploy` job, `flyctl status -a <repo-name>` and `flyctl logs -a <repo-name>`
are read-only ways to see why — reading, not deploying by hand.

Verify the live URL yourself too. The site takes a moment to come up once the
workflow finishes, so poll rather than declaring victory:

```sh
curl -sf -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}' <url>
```

Report the URL and the status code. A repo that never deployed is worth no
marks, so "the flip worked" is not the finish line — a 2xx at the live URL is.

## 5. Tag the crit state (final-project run, weeks 9–11)

From week 9 the crits and the final project share one repository (see the
assessment page's What you submit), so the repo shipped this week is the same
one that keeps moving next week. A fresh repo per week froze the marked state by
itself; in the shared repo, a tag does that job. After the deploy verifies, tag
the deployed commit and push the tag:

```sh
git tag -a crit-<week> -m "week <week> crit cutoff state" <deployed-sha>
git push origin crit-<week>
```

Resolve `<week>` from the deliverable you identified in step 1. This applies
whether or not a flip happened this week — in weeks 10 and 11 the repo is
already public and shipping is just deploy, verify, tag. Re-shipping before the
cutoff moves the tag to the new deploy (`git tag -fa`, then force-push **that
tag ref only** — the one permitted force in this course, because the cutoff
hasn't fixed the state yet). Never move a crit tag after its cutoff has passed:
from then on it records what the tutor marked, and moving it defeats the
purpose.

Weeks 2–8 don't need this — each of those prototypes is its own repo, which is
its own frozen record.

## Notes

- Never flip a repo that isn't the student's own deliverable. Read the owner and
  the name back to them first.
- Never `--force` anything, and never rewrite history on a public repo. The sole
  exception is moving a `crit-<week>` tag before its cutoff, as under step 5 —
  branches, never.
- A repo that is already public when you arrive is not an error — the student
  flipped it earlier; skip to the deploy and verify steps. Nothing in the course
  flips a student repo automatically: if it is still private, nobody has shipped
  it.
- Archived repos are read-only. If `isArchived` is true the student has been
  off-boarded; do not try to work around it, ask them to talk to the convenor.

## Hand off

- "am I ready to submit?" → **submission-preflight**
- "what's due this week?" → **deadline-radar**
- "start next week's prototype" → **new-week**
