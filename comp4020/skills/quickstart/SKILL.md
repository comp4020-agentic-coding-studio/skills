description:
  Walks a new COMP4020/COMP8020 student through first-time setup end to end —
  configuring their Claude Code strproxy API key (checking whether it's already
  set, guiding them to the key on Canvas, writing it safely into
  ~/.claude/settings.json, verifying the round-trip), accepting their invitation
  to the course GitHub org, and optionally turning on the budget status line.
  Each step is independently re-runnable, so a student who is already set up can
  come back for just one of them. Use for first-time setup, quickstart, "set up
  my key", "Claude Code isn't using the course proxy", "join the course GitHub
  org", "how do I get started", "install the status line", "show my budget in
  the status line", or "turn off the status line".

# COMP4020 quickstart: get your key working

Get a student from nothing to a working, proxy-routed Claude Code. The end state
is `~/.claude/settings.json` carrying the course proxy base URL and their `sk-…`
key, verified with a live call.

## 0. What did they actually ask for?

The steps below are independent and safe to re-run. A student who asks for one
thing should get that thing, not the whole tour:

- "install the status line" / "show my budget in the status line" / "turn the
  status line off" → **step 6**, and stop.
- "join the GitHub org" → **step 5**, and stop.
- anything open-ended ("set me up", "how do I get started") → start at step 1
  and work down.

## 1. Is it already set up?

Check before touching anything:

- Are `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` and `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` already in the environment
  or in `~/.claude/settings.json` under `env`?
- If so, verify rather than reconfigure — jump to step 4. If it verifies, the
  key half is done: don't re-ask for it, don't rewrite settings. Move on to
  step 5.

## 2. Get the key from Canvas

If there's no key, the student gets theirs from Canvas (you can't fetch it for
them — it's behind an access quiz):

1. On [canvas.anu.edu.au](https://canvas.anu.edu.au), in the course, find the
   **"Claude Code API key"** module.
2. Take the short access quiz — unlimited attempts, so retake until 100%.
3. Passing unlocks the **"Your Claude Code API key"** assignment. Open it and
   read the instructor comment on their submission — the key is the value
   starting with `sk-`.

They only ever see their own key. If the assignment stays locked, the comment is
missing, or it says "revoked", that's a convenor issue (not Anthropic support,
not the strproxy maintainers) — point them at the course support address,
comp4020@anu.edu.au.

Ask them to paste the key when they have it.

## 3. Write it into settings safely

Target `~/.claude/settings.json`. **Merge, never clobber** — read the existing
file first (it may already hold other settings), add or update just the two keys
inside the `env` object, and write it back as valid JSON:

```json
{
  "env": {
    "ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL": "https://strproxy.comp.anu.edu.au",
    "ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN": "sk-…(their key)"
  }
}
```

Notes:

- The variable is `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`, **not** `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` — the
  proxy authenticates on the `Authorization` header, which is what Claude Code
  sends for `AUTH_TOKEN`.
- If the file doesn't exist, create it. If it exists but has no `env` block, add
  one; preserve everything else verbatim.
- Confirm the write with the student before saving.
- Trim whitespace from the pasted key; a stray leading/trailing space is a
  common cause of a "revoked-looking" key that's actually fine.
- **Never echo the key back** in your response, and never suggest sending it
  anywhere except the strproxy host.

For a project-specific key instead of the user-wide one, the same block goes in
`.claude/settings.local.json` at the project root (project settings override
user settings) — offer this only if they ask.

## 4. Verify the round-trip

Two independent confirmations:

- **The proxy accepts the key** (also confirms VPN/network):
  ```sh
  curl -sf "https://strproxy.comp.anu.edu.au/api/me" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN" >/dev/null && echo OK
  ```
  200/OK = the key is valid and they're on the ANU network. A connection failure
  or 403 here usually just means they're off the VPN — the `/api/*` endpoints
  are ANU-network-only, but _model traffic isn't_, so Claude Code will still
  work. Don't block setup on a VPN-only failure; note it and move on. A 401
  means the key didn't take — recheck the paste (step 3), then Canvas (step 2).
- **Claude Code itself routes through the proxy**: note that the setting takes
  effect for _new_ sessions. `claude --print "say hi"` in a fresh shell is the
  canonical smoke test; the current session may need a restart to pick up a
  newly written `settings.json`.

## 5. Join the course GitHub org

The other thing that must be true before week 1. Your weekly repos are generated
for you inside `comp4020-agentic-coding-studio`, and until you accept the
invitation there is nothing to generate them into.

```sh
gh api /user/memberships/orgs/comp4020-agentic-coding-studio --jq .state
```

`active` and you're done. `pending` means the invitation is waiting — accept it
(offer to run this; it's their account, so confirm first):

```sh
gh api --method PATCH /user/memberships/orgs/comp4020-agentic-coding-studio \
  -f state=active
```

Do it now rather than later: **these invitations expire after seven days**, and
a lapsed one has to be re-sent by the convenor.

A `Not Found` means one of two different things. If `gh auth status` doesn't
list the `read:org` scope, the check can't see the membership even if it exists
— `gh auth refresh -h github.com -s read:org`, then re-check. If the scope is
there, no invitation is outstanding, and that's a convenor issue:
comp4020@anu.edu.au. Don't send them emailing about a problem on their own
laptop.

## 6. Optional: your budget in the status line

Offer this once the key verifies — never install it unasked. It puts the week's
spend at the bottom of every Claude Code session, green → amber → red as the cap
approaches:

```
$41.20/$100 (41%)
```

**It needs `jq`** (and `curl`, which every supported platform already has).
Check with `command -v jq`; if it's missing, install it before going further:
`brew install jq` on macOS, `sudo apt install jq` on Debian/Ubuntu/WSL, or
`mise use -g jq` anywhere. Without `jq` the bar just reads `budget: needs jq`.

It's a Unix shell script: macOS, Linux and WSL. On native Windows there's
nothing to install — that's the WSL2 nudge the **doctor** skill already gives.

To install:

1. Create the opt-in directory and copy in the script the plugin ships:

   ```sh
   mkdir -p ~/.claude/comp4020
   src=$(ls -t ~/.claude/plugins/cache/*/comp4020/*/scripts/statusline.sh 2>/dev/null | head -1)
   [ -n "$src" ] && cp "$src" ~/.claude/comp4020/statusline.sh &&
     chmod +x ~/.claude/comp4020/statusline.sh
   ```

   If `src` comes back empty, don't hunt for it — creating the directory is
   enough. A `SessionStart` hook in this plugin copies the script in on their
   next session, and keeps it current after every plugin update.

2. Merge this into `~/.claude/settings.json` — **the same merge-never-clobber
   rule as step 3**:

   ```json
   {
     "statusLine": {
       "type": "command",
       "command": "$HOME/.claude/comp4020/statusline.sh"
     }
   }
   ```

   If they **already have a `statusLine`**, leave it alone and say so. The
   script reads nothing from stdin, so their existing one can append its output
   instead:

   ```sh
   printf ' %s' "$("$HOME/.claude/comp4020/statusline.sh" </dev/null)"
   ```

3. Tell them it appears in **new** sessions, not this one.

What to say if they ask how it works, or why the number looks stale:

- It reads a cached figure and refreshes at most once a minute in the
  background, so it never slows a session down or hammers the proxy — the number
  can lag real spend by up to a minute, on top of the proxy's own
  eventually-consistent accounting. It's an indicator, not a ledger; for the
  authoritative figure use **check-balance**.
- `/api/me` is ANU-network-only, so off the VPN it keeps showing the last figure
  it managed to fetch. `budget: ?` means it has never reached the proxy — the
  usual cause is being off the VPN, and their Claude sessions still work fine.
- A key with no cap (rare) shows `$3.50 this week` and no percentage.

To turn it off: delete the `statusLine` block from `~/.claude/settings.json`.
`rm -rf ~/.claude/comp4020` as well if they want the hook to stop reinstalling
the script.

## 7. Hand off

Once the key verifies and the org membership is `active`, offer to run the
**doctor** skill to check the rest of the environment (Git, `gh`, flyctl,
Chrome), and mention **check-balance** for "how much budget do I have". Keep it
to a sentence — don't over-explain.
